# Transparent Government Project

## Overview
Nothing yet. 

Scala project structure is defined.
Need further investigation on what frameworks will be used.

### Current
Frameworks in use
- scala and akka for ingestion
  - akka-stream for api calls
  - akka-actors for mongodb dump
- mongodb for data dump

Plans (subject to change)
- python for post processing
- graphql???
- tableau???

What works
- able to ingest states and get cid dump
- able to generate required urls from cid dump
- able to connect to local mongodb and insert data
